        <h2>The "Anxious Avoider"</h2>
        <p class="bio">Elias is a 23-year-old recent graduate carrying $45,000 in student debt and struggling with high-interest credit card balances. 
            Frustrated and anxious about his finances, he avoids checking his accounts but deeply wants financial stability and 
             independence, especially the ability to rent an apartment without relying on a cosigner.</p>
